Success is a very, very lonely road. Very few people are willing to endure the 
pain, the sacrifice, and the diligence required to be successful. It’s an uphill 
battle. And along that road you’re not going to see too many friends. You’re 
going to see your shadow most often. You’ve got to trust in your heart of 
hearts, and you’ve got to trust that what you’re doing, what you believe in, is 
a worthy cause, a winnable fight. See, the thing is, for many people, they’ve 
tried the same path you’re on and they failed. As you walk this journey, you’re 
going to see carcasses all over the place of people that didn’t quite have it. 
That alone should inspire you because you got further than that one person 
and that other guy. But you’re not looking to just get further than them, you’re 
looking to finish. How do you know you’re on the right path? Where do you 
go to ensure that? Do you talk to your neighbor? No, you don’t talk to him. I’ll 
tell you about the neighbor. That neighbor is going to come in, and if you’re a 
little chubby, a little overweight, you’ll be like, “Hey, I’m thinking about doing 
a routine. I want to get in a training program. I want to lose some weight.”
